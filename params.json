Each box, when hovered, will pop a card from inside.\r\n\r\nEach box is individually placed in the container using a javascript function.\r\n\r\nYou can see a demo [Here](/web-goodies/christmas-boxes)\r\n\r\n## Let it snow\r\n\r\nThis test demonstrates the use of **CSS3 keyframe animation** in order to give a snowflake feel to your website. Each snowflake is suspended when the mouse hovers it, therefore it can easily be used for navigation links\r\n\r\nTo use it, just add the 'snowflake' class to your element.\r\n\r\nYou can see a demo [Here](/web-goodies/let-it-snow)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
