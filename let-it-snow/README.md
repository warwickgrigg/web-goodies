Let it snow
============

This test demonstrates the use of **CSS3 keyframe animation** in order to give a snowflake feel to your website. Each snowflake is suspended when the mouse hovers it, therefore it can easily be used for navigation links

To use it, just add the 'snowflake' class to your element.
